# IBL Resources 

Created July 2014.

## Professional Development

The IBL community in the United States has an annual conference called the [Legacy of RL Moore Conference][rlm]. This meeting in the summer, and is jointly sponsored by the [Educational Advancement Foundation][eaf] and the [Mathematical Association of America][maa].

In the last two years or so, a support structure for the IBL community has been constructed in the [Academy for Inquiry Based Learning][aibl]. The AIBL has a mentoring program, a small grant program, a visiting speakers program, an IBL email discussion group, lists of upcoming workshops and events, and a list of resources including links to IBL style texts and course notes.

## Course Notes

I have already mentioned the [AIBL resources][aiblres] list, which contains some examples of IBL course notes.

The [Journal of Inquiry Based Learning in Mathematics][jiblm] is a journal dedicated to disseminating peer-reviewed, class-tested course notes for IBL courses.

## Other Disciplines (not math)

We all agree that mathematics is the best reason for living, but sometimes you have to study other things. The ideas behind IBL are similar in spirit to educational initiatives in other disciplines. A few related ideas are here:

+ [Peer Instruction][pi] (originated in physics)
+ [Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning][pogil] (chemistry)
