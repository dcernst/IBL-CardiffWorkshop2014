# Abstract #

Inquiry-based learning (IBL) is a paradigm for education that puts primary responsibility for sense-making on the learner. The instructor takes on the roles of coach, cheerleader, and mentor, and manages the learning environment through careful questioning and task-setting.  An IBL approach may manifest itself in a variety of ways depending on the context, but the common theme is that students are engaged in doing mathematics the way professionals do: conjecturing, experimenting, solving problems, and making arguments.

The presenters shall share the philosophy behind this approach, a variety of classroom implementations of the ideas, and evidence for the effectiveness of IBL. Participants will engage in activities aimed at preparing for an IBL class in their setting, see some classroom video of IBL in action, and discuss the opportunities for and challenges of using IBL methods.
