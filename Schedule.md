# Workshop Goals #

1. Participants need to develop a working definition of IBL and a philosophy to go with it.
2. Participants should have ideas of basic steps they can take towards and IBL environment in some specific context.
3. Work during the workshop should be participant-driven

# Day One (15:00-16:30, 1.5 hours) #

1. Think-Pair-Share talk focusing on goals, leading to structural choices (30-40 mins)
  - TJ and Dana take turns?
2. Short break (10 mins)
3. What is IBL? (15-20 mins)
  - Dana has 7 slides
  - IBL definition
  - Spectrum idea
4. Video? (10-30 mins)
  - A good choice might be Royal's proof from "End of Semester Video" (0:00-12:00)
  - Or use one of the short DAofM videos.  Perhaps [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3H4ADPQih4) (2:24 mins)
5. Why IBL? (15-20 mins)
  - Dana has 10 slides
  - Evidence for effectiveness
  - 15 mins
6. Short testimonials (5-10 mins each)
  - No slides, just talk
  - What does TJ do?
  - What does Dana do?
7. Note cards
  - "What do you want to see tomorrow?"
  - "What questions do you have about IBL?"
  - Highlight good choices:
    * challenges/obstacles
    * IBL with large classes
    * nuts and bolts
    * syllabi
    * running a first day
    * creating problems sequences
    * resources

# Day Two (9:30-13:00, 3.5 hours) #

1. Greeting & 3x5 card summary (5-10 mins)
2. Videos and discussion (60 mins)
  - Questions to prompt participant discussion:
    * What is presenter doing?
    * What is teacher doing?
    * What is the audience doing?
    * What would you do differently?
  - Starbird videos:
    * Context: number theory at University of Texas, small class, meant to be their introduction to proof class
    * Royal's proof from "End of Semester Video" (0:00-12:30, 12:30 mins). This video is from the end of the semester.
    * Virginia's proof from "Developing a sense of proof" (5:21-10:32, 5:41 mins). This video is from week 1.
    * Other possibilities:
      - "First day" (19 mins)
      - "Awkard moments" (2 clips, 22 mins)
      - "Difficult proofs - still don't have a proof" (24 mins)
  * Discovering the Art of Mathematics videos:
      - The problem: Determine all possible values generated by the Diophantine equation $3a+5b$ when $a,b\geq 0$. It appears that perhaps $a$ and $b$ could be any integers.

      - [Small group discussion](http://www.artofmathematics.org/media/video-362) (1:53 mins), [YouTube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pto72ni3Kk)
* Short break (5 mins)
* Discussion of challenges (30-45 mins)
  - What the challenges and obstacles to implementing IBL?
  - Bring these up if they don't arise naturally:
    * Physical space
    * Coverage issue
    * Student buy-in
    * Support from colleagues and administrators
  - Small groups share out
* Short break (5 mins)
* Discussion of solutions (30-45 mins)
  - Small groups arranged by class
  - Small groups share out
* Activity "series discussion" (20-30 mins)
  - Small groups with handout
  - Small groups share out
* Nuts and Bolts discussion
  - Dana has misc slides (need to be organized)
* Burning Questions (15 mins)

# Back-up Activities #

* Content session:
  - With your group identify the big goals for your target course.
  - For each goal, try to write or identify a problem(s), where completion of the problem indicates achieving the goal.
  - For one of the goal problems, list all of the definitions, assumptions, skills, techniques necessary.
  - Using the list from the previous exercise, develop some “starter problems.”  A starter problem is a problem that every student in your class can solve or make significant progress on.
  - Develop one or more Think-Pair-Share activities.
* Mathematical inquiry activity using ghost legs or Quarto
* Additional videos
