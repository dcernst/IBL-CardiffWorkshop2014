# Stanâ€™s comments about videos #

Go with:

1. end of term
2. First Day
3. Developing a Sense of Proof


I think you can sneak in 2-3 videos.  The clips I sent are longish, but you can use just a portion.

The first -- just highlight Royal's Proof.

Then go to "Developing a sense of proof" and show Virginia's proof.  This gives two looks.  One at the end of the semester and the other in the first week, where students are getting going.  If you have more time you can show Day 1 to get to how to startup an IBL course.

The [Discovering the Art of Mathematics](http://artofmathematics.org/) has videos on their webpage, located [here](http://artofmathematics.org/media?qt-media_library=1#qt-media_library).
