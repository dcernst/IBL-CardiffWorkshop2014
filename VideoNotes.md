Go with:

1. end of term
2. First Day
3. Developing a Sense of Proof

The first -- just highlight Royal's Proof.

Then go to "Developing a sense of proof" and show Virginia's proof.  This gives two looks.  One at the end of the semester and the other in the first week, where students are getting going.  If you have more time you can show Day 1 to get to how to startup an IBL course.

Students tackling $3a+5b$ proofs:

- The problem: Determine all possible values generated by the Diophantine equation $3a+5b$ when $a,b\geq 0$. It appears that perhaps $a$ and $b$ could be any integers.
