# Brainstorming #

Day 1 is a good day to start with the end of term video of Royal.  People will want to know what IBL is like, and you can send them home with the idea and then get them to ask questions.

The issue of "Why IBL?" might be doable as well in Day 1.   Then into more details in day 2.

If the videos are "slow to watch" then maybe we don't want to start with those on day two. we probably want to start with something more active. Maybe the series activity?

How do IBL and Flipped fit together?

How do you do IBL with physical classroom constraints?
